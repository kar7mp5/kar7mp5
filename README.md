#### Python Library
- **Korean News Scraper** - 2024.03 - [Project Link](https://github.com/kar7mp5/korean-news-scraper)  
  Developed and deployed a Python library for collecting data to train Large Language Models (LLM).  
  This was my first Python library, and while there were many areas to improve, it was a great experience learning about Python deployment and automation.

- **Notion News Crawler** - 2024.07 - [Project Link](https://github.com/kar7mp5/Notion_News_Crawler), [Blog](https://kar7mp5.tistory.com/entry/%EB%85%B8%EC%85%98-%EB%A9%94%ED%81%AC%EB%A1%9C-%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%EB%B8%8C%EB%9F%AC%EB%A6%AC-%EC%A0%9C%EC%9E%91-%EC%9D%BC%EA%B8%B0)  
  Developed a crawler for collecting news by category from Notion. During development, access to Notion's database was challenging, leading to the creation of a Python library for better integration.  
  I set up a server running on a Raspberry Pi that works every 4 hours to upload relevant news to Notion.

#### AI
- **Reinforcement Learning: Drone Project** - 2024.01 ~ 2024.02 - [Project Link](https://github.com/kar7mp5/Drone_Simulation)  
  Developed a simulation for drone control using reinforcement learning. Focused on both the physical engine and reinforcement learning algorithms.

- **Large Language Model (LLM) Project** - 2024.03 ~ 2024.06 - [Project Link](https://github.com/kar7mp5/MinGPT)  
  Built a basic LLM based on the [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper for learning purposes.  
  Implemented core components of the transformer model from scratch.
